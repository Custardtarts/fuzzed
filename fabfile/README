Some thoughts
=============
Fabric is used for:

- Avoiding the abuse of distutils for Make-alike tasks that must be all done in the 'build' step.
- Avoiding the need for a private repository of our releases for APT on the production machine.
- Avoiding the handling of initscript installation, database setup a.s.o. in such a software 
  install package. Generating correct DEB files is very hard. 

Cuisine is used for easier (mostly OS-agnostic) management of software dependencies on development and production machine. Doing this as part of a generated software install package (e.g. DEB) or through explicit Fabric commands would make the solution very OS-specific, and would not solve the dev machine problem. Vagrant is also not solving the dev machine problem, is still needs a software dependency description. It just makes development easier.
