class Graph(models.Model):

    Class: Graph

    This class models a generic graph that is suitable for any diagram notation. It basically serves a container for its contained nodes and edges. Additionally, it provides functionality for serializing it.

    Fields:
     {str}            kind     - unique identifier that indicates the graph's notation (e.g. fuzztree). Must be an element of the set of available notations (See also: <notations>)
     {User}           owner    - a link to the owner of the graph
     {const datetime} created  - timestamp of the moment of graph creation (default: now)
     {bool}           deleted  - flag indicating whether this graph was deleted or not. Simplifies restoration of the graph if needed by toggling this member (default: False)

        Prints a human readable, nested version of this graph starting from the root node (node without incoming edges). Alternatively, a specific node may be passed.

        Parameters:
         {dict} tree   - a node of this graph encoded as dictionary from where the graph shall be printed. If no node is passed the root node is assumed (default: None)
         {int} indent  - number of space characters the node will be indented on the root level (default: 0)
