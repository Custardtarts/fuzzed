    Class: Graph

    This class models a generic graph that is suitable for any diagram notation. It basically serves a container for its contained nodes and edges. Additionally, it provides functionality for serializing it.

    Fields:
     {str}            kind     - unique identifier that indicates the graph's notation (e.g. fuzztree). Must be an element of the set of available notations (See also: <notations>)
     {str}            name     - the name of the graph
     {User}           owner    - a link to the owner of the graph
     {const datetime} created  - timestamp of the moment of graph creation (default: now)
     {bool}           deleted  - flag indicating whether this graph was deleted or not. Simplifies restoration of the graph if needed by toggling this member (default: False)
