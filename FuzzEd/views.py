    View handler for loging in a user using OpenID. If the user is not yet know to the system a new profile is created
    for him using his or her personal information as provided by the OpenID provider.

    The login view always redirects to the index view - and not directly to the project view - in order to keep
    the 'next' parameter handling in one place. Otherwise, the project view would need to consider the parameter too.
