<!-- 
    I know I will burn in hell for using tables to format page layout. But, it is still, even in HTML5 times, the simplest and clearest way to vertically align content with unknown height. Therefore, dear refactorer forgive me and accept my apology! You will definately get a beer on the house, if you can deliver a better solution. Kind regards, murxman@gmail.com.
