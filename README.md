# FuzzEd

FuzzEd is an browser-based editor for drawing and analyzing dependability models. The currently supported types are:

* Fault Tree Diagrams
* FuzzTree Diagrams
* Reliability Block Diagrams
* Data Flow Diagrams

The editor supports the following generic features for all diagram types:

* Organization of diagrams in projects, per user.
* Sharing of (read-only) graphs between users of the same installation. We use that heavily for education scenarios.
* Creation of diagram snapshots.
* Full clipboard functionality inside the editor.
* LaTEX, PDF and EPS export for some diagram types.
* GraphML export for all diagram types.
* Analytical and simulation-based analysis of fault tree and FuzzTree diagrams. 
* REST API for creating new diagrams with external software.

You can try the editor at http://www.fuzzed.org.

## Installation

If you just want to install your own copy of FuzzEd, please read the [installation guide](https://github.com/troeger/fuzzed/wiki/InstallationGuide).

## Development

If you want to contribute to FuzzEd, there is a lot of information in the [Wiki](https://github.com/troeger/fuzzed/wiki/Home).

For the impatient, you just need a checkout, Ubuntu and Ansible:

### Prepare and run a development machine from a checkout

* ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/localhost ansible/dev.yml
* scons frontend backend
* ./manage.py migrate --configuration=Dev
* ./manage.py runserver --configuration=Dev
* ... Coding ...
* Update the version number in FuzzEd/__init__.py
* scons package

### Prepare and run a production machine from a checkout

* scons frontend backend
* scons package
* ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/localhost -e release_version=0.X.X ansible/prod_fe.yml
* ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/localhost -e release_version=0.X.X ansible/prod_be.yml

We store our private credentials (OAuth keys etc.) for the fuzzed.org installation in an Ansible vault.
If you do the same, don't forget to add the *--ask-vault-pass* option to the line above.
