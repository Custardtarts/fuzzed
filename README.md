# FuzzEd

FuzzEd is an browser-based editor for drawing and analyzing dependability models. The currently supported types are:

* Fault Tree Diagrams
* FuzzTree Diagrams
* Reliability Block Diagrams
* Data Flow Diagrams

The editor supports the following generic features for all diagram types:

* Organization of diagrams in projects, per user.
* Sharing of (read-only) graphs between users of the same installation. We use that heavily for education scenarios.
* Creation of diagram snapshots.
* Full clipboard functionality inside the editor.
* LaTEX, PDF and EPS export for some diagram types.
* GraphML export for all diagram types.
* Analytical and simulation-based analysis of fault tree and FuzzTree diagrams. 
* REST API for creating new diagrams with external software.

You can try the editor at http://www.fuzzed.org.
