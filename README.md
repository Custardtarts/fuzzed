# ORE - The Open Reliability Editor (former FuzzEd)

Note: FuzzEd becomes ORE. We are in the middle of that process, so don't get confused while both names are still in use.

ORE is an browser-based editor for drawing and analyzing dependability models. The currently supported types are:

* Fault Tree Diagrams
* FuzzTree Diagrams
* Reliability Block Diagrams
* Data Flow Diagrams

The editor supports the following generic features for all diagram types:

* Organization of diagrams in projects, per user.
* Sharing of (read-only) graphs between users of the same installation. We use that heavily for education scenarios.
* Creation of diagram snapshots.
* Full clipboard functionality inside the editor.
* LaTEX, PDF and EPS export for some diagram types.
* GraphML export for all diagram types.
* Analytical and simulation-based analysis of fault tree and FuzzTree diagrams. 
* REST API for creating new diagrams with external software.

You can try the editor at http://fuzzed.org.

## Local installation

Currently not supported. Use http://fuzzed.org or wait for https://github.com/troeger/fuzzed/issues/107 to be finished.

## Development

Thanks for your interest in this project. We would love to have you on-board. There is some information in the [Wiki](https://github.com/troeger/fuzzed/wiki/Home). The developers discuss in the [ORE forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ore-dev).

The only tested environment for development is a Docker image.

Get a checkout of the master, or the latest release tag, and run:

``make docker-dev-build``

This takes a while and installs a development and execution environment for frontend and backend in a Docker image.

When this was successful, the next step is to enter the container:

``make docker-dev``

Inside the container, you can use SCons to build neccessary static code parts:

``scons frontend backend``

If this was successful, you need to initialize the database once:

``./manage.py migrate``

Now you can start the development web server:

``./manage.py runserver``

From this point, you should be able to use the frontend on your machine at http://localhost:8000. 

With a second SSH login into the machine, you can also have analysis and simulation services available by running:

``scons run.backend`` 

Please check the [architecture description](https://github.com/troeger/fuzzed/wiki/FuzzEdArchitecture) description page for further details.

The start page should have a *Developer Login* link right below the OAuth login logos, which works without Internet connectivity.  The OAuth login logos are broken by default, since you need [OAuth2 credentials](https://github.com/troeger/fuzzed/wiki/OAuth2Cred) to be configured for that.

If your working on a staging machine, a valid option is to get an OpenID from somewhere such as https://openid.stackexchange.com.

## Prepare and run a production machine from a checkout

    scons frontend backend
    scons package
    ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/localhost -e release_version=0.X.X ansible/prod_fe.yml
    ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/localhost -e release_version=0.X.X ansible/prod_be.yml

We store our private credentials (OAuth keys etc.) for the fuzzed.org installation in an Ansible vault.
If you do the same, don't forget to add the *--ask-vault-pass* option to the line above.

## Licence

FuzzEd ist licensed under the [GNU AGPL Version 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License). This means your are allowed to:

* Install and run the unmodified FuzzEd code at your site.
* Re-package and distribute the unmodified version of FuzzEd from this repository. 
* Fork and re-publish the editor, as long as your modified sources are accessible for everybody.

In short, AGPL forbids you to distribute or run your own modified version of FuzzEd without publishing your code.
